1.    [FB:1-4]   Determine   whether   the   equation
   for   the   time   rate   of   change   of   total   energy      E   in      a   pendulum   system   is   dimensionally   correct.       The   pendulum   system   is   a   bob   of   mass   m   swinging   on   a   string   of   length   l   held   ﬁxed   at   the   top,   as   shown   below, where g denotes gravity acting vertically downwards.    At time   t the string   is   at   angle   θ(t)   relative   to   vertical.                                                     (2   marks)

2.    [FB:1-10] Consider   the   equilibrium   heat   conduction   problem   over   0   ≤ x   ≤ 1,   with   conductivity   k(u)   >   0,   depending   on   the   temperature   u(x):
where   all   quantities   are   dimensional   in   appropriate   units.    The   next   simplest   choice   for   k(u)   after   the   constant case is to assume that the conductivity depends   linearly   on temperature,   i.e.    k(u)   =   k0   (1-bu)   where b and代 写MATHS 3021 Capstone Project in Mathematical Sciences III ASSIGNMENT 1Matlab
代做程序编程语言 k0   are positive constants.    This corresponds to a substance where the conductivity decreases   as   the   temperature   increases.
(a)    Given   [k] = MLT-3   Θ-1,   what   are   the   dimensions   of   k0    and   b?                                                                                                                                       (2   marks)
(b)    Show,   by   solving   the   equilibrium   1-D   heat   equation,   that

(Make   certain   discarding   the   positive   sign   solution   of the   quadratic   equation   is justiﬁed.)        (4   marks)
(c)    On   a   single   graph   sketch   the   equilibrium   temperature   for   b =   0.05,    0.1.    Also   sketch   the   constant   conductivity   case   on   the   same   diagram.                                                      (2   marks)
(d)    Discuss   the   physical   signiﬁcance   of the   condition   b <   1/10.                                                                                                                                                               (2   marks)
